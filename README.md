# BGDP_project
This folder contains the script file used in a course project. The aim was to explore and estimate observer intesnity in the Netherlands for bird watching. The script files are ordered by number to make it easy to reproduce the results of this project.
The script was written using Jupyter notebooks in a Python environment on ITC's geospatial platform (https://crib.utwente.nl/)
The notebooks can be downloaded and directly loaded into crib platform, and running the cells should give all outputs which were used in this project.
All files used in the analysis/modelling will be generated when the notebooks are run in the given order, except one file which was edited in excel ; that file is available in this repository to download and load in crib.
